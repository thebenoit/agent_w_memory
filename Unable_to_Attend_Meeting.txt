Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to make it to the meeting scheduled at 10 AM as planned. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

I am available to meet at 12:00 PM in New York the next day, if that works for you. Please let me know if there are any important points I should be aware of, or if there's another time we could reschedule.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Jerry
